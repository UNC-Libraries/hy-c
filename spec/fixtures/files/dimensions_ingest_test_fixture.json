            "abstract": "<b>BACKGROUND:</b> Treatment requirements of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody vasculitis (AV) and high comorbidity burden among patients with AV may lead to higher potential for polypharmacy and its associated adverse outcomes, including adverse drug events, nonadherence, drug-drug interactions, and higher costs. Medication burden and risk factors associated with polypharmacy in patients with AV have not been well-characterized. <b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To characterize medication burden and examine prevalence of and risk factors for polypharmacy in the first year after diagnosis with AV. <b>METHODS:</b> We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 2015-2017 Medicare claims to identify incident cases of AV. We counted the number of unique generic products dispensed to patients in each of the 4 quarters after diagnosis and categorized medication count as high (≥10 medications), moderate (5-9 medications), or minimal or no polypharmacy (&lt;5 medications). We used multinomial logistic regression to examine associations of predisposing, enabling, and medical need factors with having high or moderate polypharmacy. <b>RESULTS:</b> In 1,239 Medicare beneficiaries with AV, high or moderate polypharmacy was most common in the first quarter after diagnosis (83.7%), with 43.2% taking 5 - 9 medications and 40.5% taking at least 10. The odds of high polypharmacy were greater in all quarters for patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis compared with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, ranging from 2.02 (95% CI = 1.18 - 3.46) in the third quarter to 2.96 (95% CI = 1.64-5.33) in the second quarter. Older age, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, obesity, a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score, coverage with Medicaid/Part D low-income subsidy, and living in areas with low education or persistent poverty were risk factors for high or moderate polypharmacy. <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Medicare beneficiaries with newly diagnosed AV experienced a high medication burden, with more than 40% taking at least 10 medications and the highest rates among those with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Patients with AV may benefit from medication therapy management interventions to manage complex drug regimens and reduce risks associated with polypharmacy. <b>DISCLOSURES:</b> Dr Derebail receives personal fees from Travere Therapeutics, Pfizer, Bayer, Forma Therapeutics, UpToDate, outside of the submitted work.

            "abstract": "Persons living with HIV (PLWH) may be at increased risk for polypharmacy (≥5 concomitant medications) over non-PLWH, presumably due to antiretroviral therapy (ARV). Potential concerns associated with polypharmacy include clinically significant drug-drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, increased pill burden, and rising treatment-related costs. Our objective was to evaluate prescription of multiple non-ARV medications to PLWH, compared to non-PLWH, in US outpatient clinics and to identify factors associated with polypharmacy. Cross-sectional data from the 2006-2010 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used for this study. Visits for PLWH were identified using HIV ICD9-CM codes 042, V08, and 079.53. Patients < 18 years of age were excluded. Relevant demographics included sex, age, race/ethnicity, and insurance status, while comorbid conditions included hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Multivariate logistic regression analyses evaluated factors independently associated with prescription of ≥ 5 medications. In total, 7,360,000 weighted visits for PLWH (13% aged 18-29 y; 55% aged 30-49 y; 32% aged ≥ 50 y) and 374,626,000 weighted visits for non-PLWH (18% aged 18-29 y; 32% aged 30-49 y; 50% aged ≥ 50 y) met study criteria. The greatest prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia was in those ≥ 50 years of age (p < .001 for all comorbidities in PLWH and non-PLWH). In 2006, 16% of PLWH were prescribed ≥ 5 medications, doubling to 35% in 2010. In 2006, 24% of non-PLWH were prescribed ≥ 5 medications, only increasing to 32% in 2010. Older age (30-49 y and ≥ 50 y) was associated with ≥ 5 prescription medications in PLWH (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.538, 95% CI; 1.31-4.918 and aOR = 2.703, 95% CI; 1.678-4.354) and in non-PLWH (aOR = 2.546, 95% CI; 2.235-2.9 and aOR = 5.208, 95% CI; 4.486-6.047), respectively. Prescription of multiple medications is on the rise in PLWH, more so than in non-PLWH. Additional research is needed to explore how prescription of multiple medications differentially affects younger PLWH vs. older PLWH.",

In particular, tau post-translational modifications (PTMs) are thought to generate aberrant tau species resulting in neuronal dysfunction. Despite being well characterized in postmortem AD brain, it is unclear how caspase-mediated C-terminal tau cleavage promotes neurodegeneration, as few studies have developed the models to dissect this pathogenic mechanism. Here, we show that proteasome impairment results in cleaved tau accumulation at the post-synaptic density (PSD), a process that is modulated by neuronal activity. Cleaved tau (at residue D421) impairs neuronal firing and causes inefficient initiation of network bursts, consistent with reduced excitatory drive. We propose that reduced neuronal activity, or silencing, is coupled to proteasome dysfunction, which drives cleaved tau accumulation at the PSD and subsequent synaptotoxicity. Our study connects three common themes in the progression of AD: impaired proteostasis, caspase-mediated tau cleavage, and synapse degeneration.",

Toxicity mechanisms, also known as Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs), that explain these metal-induced toxicities are severely understudied. Therefore, we deployed in silico structure- and knowledge-based approaches to identify proteome-level perturbations caused by metals and pathways that link these events to human diseases. We captured 177 structure-based, 347 knowledge-based, and 402 imputed metal-gene/protein relationships for chromium, cobalt, molybdenum, nickel, and titanium. We prioritized 72 proteins hypothesized to directly contact implant surfaces and contribute to adverse outcomes. Results of this exploratory analysis were formalized as structured AOPs. We considered three case studies reflecting the following possible situations: (i) the metal-protein-disease relationship was previously known; (ii) the metal-protein, protein-disease, and metal-disease relationships were individually known but were not linked (as a unified AOP); and (iii) one of three relationships was unknown and was imputed by our methods. These situations were illustrated by case studies on nickel-induced allergy/hypersensitivity, cobalt-induced heart failure, and titanium-induced periprosthetic osteolysis, respectively.

Here, we present a potentially generalized approach for transforming a given protein of interest (POI) into an optogenetic species. We describe the rational and methods by which we developed three different optogenetic POIs utilizing the Cry2-Cib photodimerizing pair. The process pipeline is highlighted by (1) developing a low level, constitutively active POI that is independent of endogenous regulation, (2) fusion of the mutant protein of interest to an optogenetic photodimerizing system, and (3) light-mediated recruitment of the light-responsive POI to specific subcellular regions.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that clonal cells can make different fate decisions, but it is unclear whether these decisions are determined during, or before, a cell's own lifetime. Here, we engineered an endogenous fluorescent reporter for the pluripotency factor OCT4 to study the timing of differentiation decisions in human embryonic stem cells. By tracking single-cell OCT4 levels over multiple cell cycle generations, we found that the decision to differentiate is largely determined before the differentiation stimulus is presented and can be predicted by a cell's preexisting OCT4 signaling patterns. We further quantified how maternal OCT4 levels were transmitted to, and distributed between, daughter cells. As mother cells underwent division, newly established OCT4 levels in daughter cells rapidly became more predictive of final OCT4 expression status. These results imply that the choice between developmental cell fates can be largely predetermined at the time of cell birth through inheritance of a pluripotency factor.",

            "abstract": "In 1973, a technique of administering 6-hydroxydopamine (2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylethylamine) intracisternally to neonate rats was introduced to selectively reduce brain dopamine (neonate-lesioned rat). This neonate treatment proved unique when compared to rats lesioned as adults with 6-hydroxydopamine--prompting the discovery of differing functional characteristics resulting from the age at which brain dopamine is reduced. A realization was that neonate-lesioned rats modeled the loss of central dopamine and the increased susceptibility for self-injury in Lesch-Nyhan disease, which allowed identification of drugs useful in treating self-injury in mentally retarded patients. The neonate-lesioned rat has also been proposed to model the hyperactivity observed in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Because the neonate-lesioned rat exhibits enhanced sensitization to repeated NMDA receptor antagonist administration and has functional changes characteristic of schizophrenia, the neonate lesioning is believed to emulate the hypothesized NMDA hypofunction in this psychiatric disorder. Besides modeling features of neurological and psychiatric disorders, important neurobiological concepts emerged from pharmacological studies in the neonate-lesioned rats. One was the discovery of coupling of D1/D2-dopamine receptor function. Another was the progressive increase in responsiveness to repeated D1-dopamine agonist administration referred to as \"priming\" of D1-dopamine receptor function. Additionally, a unique profile of signaling protein expression related to neonate reduction of dopamine has been identified. Thus, from modeling characteristics of disease to defining adaptive mechanisms related to neonatal loss of dopamine, the neonate-lesioned rat has had a persisting influence on neuroscience. Despite an extraordinary legacy from studies of the neurobiology of this treatment, a host of unknowns remain that will inspire future investigations.",

We formalize COPs as a chain of the following events: molecular initiating event (MIE) → intermediate event(s) → clinical outcome. We illustrate the concept with COP examples both for primary and alternative (i.e., drug repurposing) therapeutic applications. We also describe the elucidation of COPs for several drugs of interest using the publicly accessible Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge-Oriented Pathways (ROBOKOP) biomedical knowledge graph-mining tool. We propose that broader use of COP uncovered with the help of biomedical knowledge graph mining will likely accelerate drug discovery and repurposing efforts.",

Current treatment relies on the intravenous infusion of recombinant or purified Factor proteins. Factor infusion is effective, but transient due to the short half-life of Factor proteins. Recent developments in gene transfer technology have led to new strategies using molecular therapeutics as permanent treatment for bleeding disorders. This review describes recent novel molecular strategies for the treatment of the hemophilias.",
