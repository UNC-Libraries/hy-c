* If you use Atom, get the Dockerfile specific grammar (may need to restart Atom to see effect)
```bash
apm install language-docker
```
* Files and directories that should not be included in the image should be put in the `.dockerignore` file
* Build the docker image
```bash
docker compose build
```
* Copy .bashrc into web container (I've tried to do this in the Dockerfile but it hasn't been working)
```bash
docker cp ./docker/.bashrc hy-c-web-1:/root/.bashrc
```
* Bash into running container
```bash
docker compose exec web bash
```
