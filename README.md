# Hy-C

![Build](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/hy-c/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=main)

#### Hyrax based system underlying the Carolina Digital Repository

* Currently using Hyrax version 2.9.5
* Currently in production
* Hosts institutional repository content at UNC Chapel Hill

#### Customizations

* Automatically assign AdminSet based on work type
* Custom workflows:
    * New withdrawn state for works
    * Honors thesis workflow automatically assigns departmental group as reviewer for deposited works
* Updated deposit/edit form with combined files and metadata tabs
* Import scripts for new ProQuest deposits
* Merges old and new analytics data from Google Analytics

#### Testing
* Creating Solr fixture objects (see `spec/support/oai_sample_solr_documents.rb` )
  * Run the test_setup rake task in order to get all the fixtures in the development environment
  ```
  bundle exec rake test_setup RAILS_ENV=development
  ```

  * Search in your development environment front end to find the ID for the object you want to update (if using the UNC-CH VM this will be at localhost:4040, if you are running it locally on the default rails server, it will be at localhost:3000)
  * Go into a rails console to retrieve objects
  ```
  bundle exec rails console RAILS_ENV=development
  ```
  * On the rails console, find the object.
    * If the url is https://localhost:4040/concern/articles/5x21tf41f?locale=en then the model is `Article` and the id is `5x21tf41f`.
    Example:
    ```ruby
    work = Article.find("5x21tf41f")
    work.to_solr.deep_symbolize_keys!
    ```
    ```ruby
    work = YourModel.find("YourIdAsAString")
    work.to_solr.deep_symbolize_keys!
    ```
    * Copy the output of this to the sample_solr_documents file. Add a unique `:timestamp` value to the hash (e.g. `:timestamp => "2021-11-23T16:05:33.033Z"`) so that the `spec/requests/oai_pmh_endpoint_spec.rb` tests to continue to pass.
